# A-project (a Valuable lesson)

This project is to create a vocabulary flashcard based on url that user input.

This project will be indefinitely paused because I realized that the way I progressed this project was not proper.

For now, I thought that I have asked ChatGPT for guidance. However, actually I was just coping and tring to understand it. 
I realized that it doesn't really help me to learn by continuing a project in this way and it continuously caused sudden, unknown errors. 
So, I decided to pause this project and start from a new, simple project. 
This time, even though I have no idea about how to develop a code, I will struggle and learn from that experience. 

Here's a thing that I learned from this project.

### Do not give a man a fish but teach hime how to fish.

I promise that I will use internet sources properly in a way that benefits me.
